# Autolume (legacy)

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

> [!WARNING]
> **This repository is deprecated and no longer maintained.**
>
> Active development has moved to the new, clean repository:
> **[Metacreation-Lab/autolume](https://github.com/Metacreation-Lab/autolume)**

### Why the move?
This legacy repository became bloated with large binary files (>1GB). We have performed a full history rewrite to create a lightweight, clean version of the codebase.

Because the history was rewritten, **the new repository is not compatible with this one.**

### Action Required
* **For Users:** Please clone the new repository to ensure you have the latest stable version without the download overhead.
* **For Contributors:** Please re-fork the new repository. Pull requests against this legacy repository will not be merged.

### Deletion Timeline
This archive is read-only and will be permanently deleted **by the end of 2026**.
